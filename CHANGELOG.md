# Changelog

All notable changes to Kittine are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Kittine does not yet follow Semantic Versioning tags/releases — entries are
grouped by date until the first tagged release.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-07-18

### Changed

- **Breaking:** removed the `¨...¨` diaeresis-quoted string form. Strings are
  now written with `'...'` or `"..."` — fully interchangeable, pick whichever
  avoids escaping. Existing `.kitty` source using `¨...¨` must be updated.

### Added

- **Boolean literals**: `yes>` / `no>`, lowering to Rust's `true` / `false`.
- **Array literals**: `[expr, expr, ..]`, lowering to `vec![..]`.
  `craft<[..]>` formats arrays with `{:?}` instead of `{}`.
- **Type tags**: `<<Num>>`, `<<Word>>`, `<<Flag>>` — optional explicit type
  annotations on a value. Checked against literal values at parse time
  (`<<Num>> 'oops'` is now a parse error) and erased during code generation.
- **`spin` loops**: `spin<{item}> in list }{ .. }{` iterates an array,
  binding each element to `item`. Lowers to a plain Rust `for` loop. The
  `}{` fence — a closing brace immediately followed by an opening one — is
  the loop-body delimiter.
- `vercel.json` and `.vercelignore` for one-step Vercel deployment of
  `example-app`: installs a minimal Rust toolchain and `wasm-bindgen-cli`
  (version read from `Cargo.lock`, not hardcoded) during the Vercel build,
  then runs the existing `npm run build:plugin && npm run build` pipeline.
- Immutable long-term caching headers for Vite's content-hashed
  `example-app/dist/assets/*` output.

### Fixed

- `example-app/Cargo.toml`'s `[profile.release]` now sets `lto = true`,
  `codegen-units = 1`, `strip = true`, and `panic = "abort"` alongside the
  existing `opt-level = "s"`, cutting the shipped `.wasm` from ~227 KB to
  ~76 KB (~54 KB → ~28 KB gzipped) for the example app.

### Repository

- `main` is now the GitHub default branch; the old auto-generated
  `merged-syntax-branch` branch has been deleted.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Initial Kittine monorepo: `kittine-compiler` (lexer, parser, codegen
  targeting Leptos 0.7), `vite-plugin-kittine`, and `example-app`.
- `func`, `<{name}> >> value` (declare-or-mutate signals), `craft<...>`
  logging, `if>` / `orif>` / `else>` indentation-delimited control flow,
  and the embedded JSX-like `return ( ... )` view syntax.
- String concatenation via `+`: either operand being a string literal
  lowers the whole expression to `format!("{}{}", ..)`.
- `vscode-kittine`: a VS Code extension with TextMate-grammar syntax
  highlighting, bracket matching, and a dedicated file icon for `.kitty`
  files.
- Full documentation set under `docs/` (language reference, architecture,
  CLI, getting started, VS Code extension).
